The AlexaSkill folder contains the code and related files for our Alexa skill created in Node.js. This is hosted on AWS Lambda.

The DirectionServiceAPI contains the ASP.NET Web API that connects Alexa with Unity. This is hosted on Microsoft Azure at cchackers.azurewebsites.net (note there are only a few endpoints, and the site does not have a home page).

The Unity project is not included here because a large chunk of it is binary files
